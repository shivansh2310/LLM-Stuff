Electricity  constitutes  the  input  into  many  products  that  produced  by  industry  and  used  by  people.  Hence,
it can  be  considered  as  a  product  or  service  that  has  vital  importance  in  human  life  and  economy.  Since
it has  such  special  properties  of  instantaneous  production  and  consumption  obligation  and  unfeasible
storage, electricity  market  is  not  like  other  markets.  In  a  competitive  electricity  market,  generation  com-
pany faces  price  risks  and  delivery  risks.  So  that  risk  management  is  an  important  part  of  a  generation
company and  can  deeply  effect  companies’  proﬁtability.  This  paper  focuses  on  electricity  generation  asset
allocation between  bilateral  contracts,  such  as  forward  contracts,  and  daily  spot  market,  considering  con-
straints of  generating  units  and  spot  price  risks.  The  problem  is  to  ﬁnd  the  optimal  portfolio  based  on
known electricity  generation  total  costs,  bilateral  contract  prices,  it  employed  Turkish  historical  balanced
market hourly  system  marginal  and  day-ahead  hourly  market  prices  between  of  2006  and  2011.  There
are limited  studies  about  portfolio  optimization  in  electricity  markets  in  literature  and  this  paper  should
be considered  frontier  study  taking  spot  market’s  hourly  prices  separately  as  risky  assets.  Markowitz
mean-variance optimization which is claimed to be the beginning of modern portfolio theory in ﬁnancial
sector is  used  to  demonstrate  this  approach.  Mean-variance  optimization  has  been  successfully  applied
to all  cases  that  modeled  for  electricity  market.  Some  suggestions  for  future  work  are  also  listed  in  this
paper.

1.  Introduction
In  many  countries  today,  there  is  a  remarkable  tendency  for
deregulation  and  restructuring  of  electric  power  industries.  Turkey
is  one  of  these  countries  and  it  is  also  in  a  restructuring  period.  It  is
aiming to  deregulate  all  electricity  industry  until  2015.  However,
this  new  market  environment  brings  along  some  risks.  In  a  com-
petitive  environment,  generation  companies’  main  objective  is  to
maximize  their  proﬁt  and  minimize  the  associated  risks,  therefore
clear  determination  of  the  risks  and  taking  necessary  steps  are  very
important. It is essential to create a trading strategy with risk man-
agement before bidding into spot markets (high proﬁt with volatile
prices)  and  bilateral  contract  market  (moderate  proﬁt  with  stable
prices).  At  this  point,  main  step  is  the  determination  of  portfolio
weights and optimization of the portfolio with respect to investors’
risk aversion.
Various risk management techniques have been applied to elec-
tricity  markets.  Risk  management  can  be  divided  into  two  main
sections; risk control and risk assessment. In the study of Liu and
Wu [1], hedging and portfolio optimization have been deﬁned as
risk control techniques. On the other hand risk measurement and
asset  valuation  are  described  as  risk  assessment  techniques.  Hedg-
ing  is  necessary  to  offset  risk  of  position  (generally  in  spot  markets)
and  to  reach  this  goal  investors  must  buy  some  other  derivatives
like  forward contracts, future contracts, options and swaps, etc.
[2,3] .  In  electricity  markets  hedging  the  risk  of  spot  price  with  for-
ward  contract  and  futures  contract  have  been  investigated  [4,5] .
Forward  contracts, purchased by a consumer are commitment by
the  suppliers  to  provide  a  speciﬁed  amount  of  electrical  energy  at
a  future  time,  are  particularly  useful  for  coordinating  supply  and
demand  side  operations  decisions  under  spot  pricing  [4].  A  future
contract  obligates each party to buy or sell a speciﬁed amount
of  energy  at  a  speciﬁed  price.  But,  buyers  and  sellers  of  future
contracts  deal  with  an  exchange,  not  with  each  other  [6].  Hedg-
ing  techniques using futures contracts in electricity market appear
to  have  lower  standard  deviation  or  risk  [5].  Options,  Swaps  and
special  electricity  contracts  (callable  forward  contract,  puttable
forward  contract)  are  also  determined  as  other  tools  for  hedging
strategies.
Portfolio  optimization,  listed  among  risk  control  techniques,
refers  to  optimally  allocation  of  energy  trading  tools  with  the  aim
of  maximizing beneﬁts while minimizing the corresponding risk.
Except  Monte Carlo Method in reference study of Vehviläinen and
Keppo,  there  are  two  types  of  methods  can  be  used  to  solve  portfo-
lio  optimization  problems:  Decision  analysis  and  modern  portfolio
theory  [6,7] .  Decision  analysis  is  the  determination  of  all  possible
events  with  its  consequences  and  probabilities  and  the  constitu-
tion  of  decision  tree  with  respect  to  these  data  and  the  evaluation
of  tree [8]. Modern portfolio theory (MPT), which is the subject of
this  paper, is the other technique that can be used for portfolio
optimization  [1,2,6–12] .  Mean-variance  optimization  is  the  essen-
tial  part  of  this  approach.  Only  few  studies  have  been  done  by  using
MPT  in  electricity  markets.  It  is  very  popular  in  ﬁnancial  literature
but  it  is  brand  new  approach  for  electricity  markets.  Risk  assess-
ment  techniques  for  portfolio  optimization  are  not  scope  of  this
study  so  it  is  not  necessary  to  give  additional  information  on  them.
Section  2  introduces  the  background  of  the  electricity  market
with  different  trading  regimes  and  pricing  system  which  includes
trading  environment.  Section  2  also  introduces  current  status  ofTurkish
 electricity  market.  Section  3  describes  the  fundamental
theory  and  methodology  (especially  mean-variance  optimization)
to  portfolio  optimization  which  can  be  applied  to  electricity  mar-
kets.  Section  4  explains  data  and  methodology  and  includes  the
application  of  mean  variance  to  electricity  market  environment.
Section 5  demonstrates  results  of  study  in  graphically  and  table
representation  forms.  Finally,  Section  6  provides  conclusions.
2. Current  status  of  Turkish  electricity  market
Electricity  markets  in  the  world  generally  offer  two  types  of
market  structure:  spot  market  and  physical  market.  In  addition  to
these,  there are derivative markets too. Spot markets include bal-
ance  and/or  day  ahead  spot  markets  while  physical  markets  include
bilateral  and/or  physical  forward  contracts.  There  are  also  deriva-
tive  markets  (for  ﬁnancial  instrumentation  of  electricity  with,
futures,  option,  swap  and  special  other  derivatives)  in  some  of  the
electricity  trading  regimes.
To  keep  interconnected  system  in  a  stable  condition,  it  is  nec-
essary  to  keep  frequency  value  of  network  in  a  bound  around  a
speciﬁc  value.2Instantaneous  load  changes  must  be  compensated
by  load  rejection/acceptation  of  generation  units.  Excess  power  in
networks  causes  increase  in  frequency  while  opposite  case  causes
decrease  in frequency. Balance markets are founded to respond this
need in a short time (generally less than 15 min) so that they are
deﬁned as real time markets. As to day-ahead market all energy
traded  approximately 24 h (in Turkish electricity market between
12  and  36  h  before  real  consumption  time)  before  real  consumption
time.  The  common  scenario  among  these  markets  is  that  they  all
involve  a centralized auction mechanism, by Independent System
Operators  (ISOs),  Regional  Transmission  Operators  (RTO)  or  any
such  organizations,  to  determine  which  generation  units  should  be
deployed  and how much energy should be produced to meet the
demand  by selected unit [1]. Depends on the countries spot mar-
ket  mechanism  preferences,  trading  intervals  to  submit  bids  in  spot
market  can  be  different.  For  instance,  in  NEM  of  Australia,  the  time
interval  for  electricity  trading  is  deﬁned  as  30  min  but  all  counter-
parts  can  give  their  bids  for  every  5  min.  In  Greece,  STA  has  single
and  separate  market  for  each  hour.  In  England  and  New  Zealand,
NETA  and  NZEM  have  48  half  hour  trading  periods  for  each  day.
In  IMO of Ontario bids and/or offers are submitted for every 5 min.
As  to  Elspot  in  Nordic  market,  market  participants  bid  for  purchase
and  sale  of  power  contracts  1-h  duration  for  all  24  h  of  the  next
day.  Turkish  electricity  market  has  been  operated  for  hourly  trading
interval,  too.
Three  types  of  pricing  mechanism  are  common  in  world’s  energy
markets:  Uniform  marginal  pricing,  zonal  pricing  and  locational
(or  nodal) pricing. In balance market, some other pricing system
which  is  called  as  pay-as-bid  or  discriminatory  pricing  system  can
also  be  seen  for  instance  Wales  and  England  market.  In  markets,
where  uniform  marginal  pricing  were  adopted,  only  one  energy
price  is  used  for  ex  post  settlement  for  each  trading  interval.
Generation  companies  can  make  certain  of  their  revenues  by  sign-
ing  bilateral  contracts  with  their  customers  at  ﬁxed  energy  prices.
In  zonal pricing systems, there is a geographical point of view to

market  structure  and  all  system  divided  sub  systems  with  respect
to  pre-deﬁned  geographical  areas,  called  zones.  When  there  is  no
congestion between zones, one uniform market clearing price is
used  throughout  the  system.  Under  congestion  conditions  all  zones
separated  each  other  and  produce  their  own  market  clearing  prices,
called  zonal  prices.  These  pricing  systems  have  congestion  risks  for
bilateral markets because of their uncertain and unpredictable pric-
ing mechanisms. Zonal pricing is still used in Nordic (11 zones) and
some  other  markets  [13].  Locational  marginal  pricing  is  the  deter-
mination of  prices  in  each  location  or  node  of  power  system.  When
there  is no congestion, one market clearing price is used in the sys-
tem  (ignoring  transmission  loses)  same  as  zonal  pricing.  In  zonal
and  locational  pricing  regimes,  except  contract  with  customers  at
the  same location or zone, all contracts are risky [1]. Theoretical
point  of  view,  methodology  for  each  pricing  system  is  the  same.
In Turkey, deregulation and reconstruction processes are pro-
ceeding.  Turkish  authorities  are  planning  to  reach  completely
deregulated  market  environment  before  2015.  With  respect  to
Turkey  Progress  Report  of  European  Union  2009,  the  thresh-
old  for  eligible  consumers  was  further  reduced  to  480,000  kWh,
equivalent  to  opening  50%  of  market  [14].  After  this  report  Turk-
ish  Energy Market Regulator Authority published new threshold
value  as  100,000  kWh  [15].  Turkey  is  adopting  European  Market
Model  to  itself,  in  that  respect  Nordic  Electricity  Market  struc-
ture  is  a  good  example  for  Turkey.  Turkish  electricity  market
consists  of  two  main  market  environments  now:  balanced  mar-
ket  for  balancing  load  imbalances  as  a  spot  market  and  bilateral
contract  application.  Day-ahead  planning  is  in  service  to  pre-
pare  market participants to day-ahead market. In near future (at
the  end  of  2011)  day-ahead  market  will  be  available  for  energy
traders.  In  Fig.  1  common  details  of  target  model  of  Turkey  can  be
seen.

 Portfolio  optimization  theory
3.1. Modern  portfolio  theory
In classical portfolio theory, it is thought that you can
avoid  your investment risk by constructing your portfolio from
different  industries’ shares, treasury bills with different maturities,
and  different  foreign  currencies,  in  other  words  via  diversiﬁcation.In
 modern portfolio theory, taking into consideration of relations
(correlations, co-movement)  of  portfolio  assets  with  each  other  is
very  important  and  diversiﬁcation  is  necessary  but  not  the  only
solution  of  portfolio  risk  management.  Taking  these  co-movements
of  securities  into  account  satisﬁes  an  ability  to  construct  a  port-
folio  that  has  the  same  expected  return  and  less  risky  portfolio
than  a  portfolio  constructed  by  ignoring  the  interactions  between
securities  [1].
It  is  impossible  for  investors  to  know  exactly  what  the  asset’s
return  and  risk  will  be  tomorrow,  so  they  are  using  some  forecast-
ing  tools to determine these values. The main problem by which
investors  must  be  faced  is  to  ﬁguring  out  weight  percentages  of
assets  being  in  the  portfolio.  This  problem  is  called  as  portfolio
selection  problem. To ﬁnd a solution to this problem, Harry M.
Markowitz  published  a  paper,  which  is  called  as  milestone  study
for portfolio theory and fundamentals of modern portfolio theory,
“Portfolio  Selection ”  in  1952  [3].  Markowitz,  in  his  famous  paper,
argued  that  a  process  of  portfolio  selection  can  be  divided  into  two
stages.  “The  ﬁrst  stage  starts  with  observation  and  experience  and  end
with  beliefs  about  the  future  performances  of  available  securities.  The
second  stage  starts  with  the  relevant  beliefs  about  future  performances
and  ends with the choice of portfolio.” His paper is concerned about
the  second  stage  [11].  His  body  of  work  on  portfolio  theory  resulted
in  him  bein
