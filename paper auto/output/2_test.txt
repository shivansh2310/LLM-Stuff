Electricity  constitutes  the  input  into  many  products  that  produced  by  industry  and  used  by  people.  Hence,
it can  be  considered  as  a  product  or  service  that  has  vital  importance  in  human  life  and  economy.  Since
it has  such  special  properties  of  instantaneous  production  and  consumption  obligation  and  unfeasible
storage, electricity  market  is  not  like  other  markets.  In  a  competitive  electricity  market,  generation  com-
pany faces  price  risks  and  delivery  risks.  So  that  risk  management  is  an  important  part  of  a  generation
company and  can  deeply  effect  companies’  proﬁtability.  This  paper  focuses  on  electricity  generation  asset
allocation between  bilateral  contracts,  such  as  forward  contracts,  and  daily  spot  market,  considering  con-
straints of  generating  units  and  spot  price  risks.  The  problem  is  to  ﬁnd  the  optimal  portfolio  based  on
known electricity  generation  total  costs,  bilateral  contract  prices,  it  employed  Turkish  historical  balanced
market hourly  system  marginal  and  day-ahead  hourly  market  prices  between  of  2006  and  2011.  There
are limited  studies  about  portfolio  optimization  in  electricity  markets  in  literature  and  this  paper  should
be considered  frontier  study  taking  spot  market’s  hourly  prices  separately  as  risky  assets.  Markowitz
mean-variance optimization which is claimed to be the beginning of modern portfolio theory in ﬁnancial
sector is  used  to  demonstrate  this  approach.  Mean-variance  optimization  has  been  successfully  applied
to all  cases  that  modeled  for  electricity  market.  Some  suggestions  for  future  work  are  also  listed  in  this
paper.

1.  Introduction
In  many  countries  today,  there  is  a  remarkable  tendency  for
deregulation  and  restructuring  of  electric  power  industries.  Turkey
is  one  of  these  countries  and  it  is  also  in  a  restructuring  period.  It  is
aiming to  deregulate  all  electricity  industry  until  2015.  However,
this  new  market  environment  brings  along  some  risks.  In  a  com-
petitive  environment,  generation  companies’  main  objective  is  to
maximize  their  proﬁt  and  minimize  the  associated  risks,  therefore
clear  determination  of  the  risks  and  taking  necessary  steps  are  very
important. It is essential to create a trading strategy with risk man-
agement before bidding into spot markets (high proﬁt with volatile
prices)  and  bilateral  contract  market  (moderate  proﬁt  with  stable
prices).  At  this  point,  main  step  is  the  determination  of  portfolio
weights and optimization of the portfolio with respect to investors’
risk aversion.
Various risk management techniques have been applied to elec-
tricity  markets.  Risk  management  can  be  divided  into  two  main
sections; risk control and risk assessment. In the study of Liu and
Wu [1], hedging and portfolio optimization have been deﬁned as
risk control techniques. On the other hand risk measurement and
asset  valuation  are  described  as  risk  assessment  techniques.  Hedg-
ing  is  necessary  to  offset  risk  of  position  (generally  in  spot  markets)
and  to  reach  this  goal  investors  must  buy  some  other  derivatives
like  forward contracts, future contracts, options and swaps, etc.
[2,3] .  In  electricity  markets  hedging  the  risk  of  spot  price  with  for-
ward  contract  and  futures  contract  have  been  investigated  [4,5] .
Forward  contracts, purchased by a consumer are commitment by
the  suppliers  to  provide  a  speciﬁed  amount  of  electrical  energy  at
a  future  time,  are  particularly  useful  for  coordinating  supply  and
demand  side  operations  decisions  under  spot  pricing  [4].  A  future
contract  obligates each party to buy or sell a speciﬁed amount
of  energy  at  a  speciﬁed  price.  But,  buyers  and  sellers  of  future
contracts  deal  with  an  exchange,  not  with  each  other  [6].  Hedg-
ing  techniques using futures contracts in electricity market appear
to  have  lower  standard  deviation  or  risk  [5].  Options,  Swaps  and
special  electricity  contracts  (callable  forward  contract,  puttable
forward  contract)  are  also  determined  as  other  tools  for  hedging
strategies.
Portfolio  optimization,  listed  among  risk  control  techniques,
refers  to  optimally  allocation  of  energy  trading  tools  with  the  aim
of  maximizing beneﬁts while minimizing the corresponding risk.
Except  Monte Carlo Method in reference study of Vehviläinen and
Keppo,  there  are  two  types  of  methods  can  be  used  to  solve  portfo-
lio  optimization  problems:  Decision  analysis  and  modern  portfolio
theory  [6,7] .  Decision  analysis  is  the  determination  of  all  possible
events  with  its  consequences  and  probabilities  and  the  constitu-
tion  of  decision  tree  with  respect  to  these  data  and  the  evaluation
of  tree [8]. Modern portfolio theory (MPT), which is the subject of
this  paper, is the other technique that can be used for portfolio
optimization  [1,2,6–12] .  Mean-variance  optimization  is  the  essen-
tial  part  of  this  approach.  Only  few  studies  have  been  done  by  using
MPT  in  electricity  markets.  It  is  very  popular  in  ﬁnancial  literature
but  it  is  brand  new  approach  for  electricity  markets.  Risk  assess-
ment  techniques  for  portfolio  optimization  are  not  scope  of  this
study  so  it  is  not  necessary  to  give  additional  information  on  them.
Section  2  introduces  the  background  of  the  electricity  market
with  different  trading  regimes  and  pricing  system  which  includes
trading  environment.  Section  2  also  introduces  current  status  ofTurkish
 electricity  market.  Section  3  describes  the  fundamental
theory  and  methodology  (especially  mean-variance  optimization)
to  portfolio  optimization  which  can  be  applied  to  electricity  mar-
kets.  Section  4  explains  data  and  methodology  and  includes  the
application  of  mean  variance  to  electricity  market  environment.
Section 5  demonstrates  results  of  study  in  graphically  and  table
representation  forms.  Finally,  Section  6  provides  conclusions.
2. Current  status  of  Turkish  electricity  market
Electricity  markets  in  the  world  generally  offer  two  types  of
market  structure:  spot  market  and  physical  market.  In  addition  to
these,  there are derivative markets too. Spot markets include bal-
ance  and/or  day  ahead  spot  markets  while  physical  markets  include
bilateral  and/or  physical  forward  contracts.  There  are  also  deriva-
tive  markets  (for  ﬁnancial  instrumentation  of  electricity  with,
futures,  option,  swap  and  special  other  derivatives)  in  some  of  the
electricity  trading  regimes.
To  keep  interconnected  system  in  a  stable  condition,  it  is  nec-
essary  to  keep  frequency  value  of  network  in  a  bound  around  a
speciﬁc  value.2Instantaneous  load  changes  must  be  compensated
by  load  rejection/acceptation  of  generation  units.  Excess  power  in
networks  causes  increase  in  frequency  while  opposite  case  causes
decrease  in frequency. Balance markets are founded to respond this
need in a short time (generally less than 15 min) so that they are
deﬁned as real time markets. As to day-ahead market all energy
traded  approximately 24 h (in Turkish electricity market between
12  and  36  h  before  real  consumption  time)  before  real  consumption
time.  The  common  scenario  among  these  markets  is  that  they  all
involve  a centralized auction mechanism, by Independent System
Operators  (ISOs),  Regional  Transmission  Operators  (RTO)  or  any
such  organizations,  to  determine  which  generation  units  should  be
deployed  and how much energy should be produced to meet the
demand  by selected unit [1]. Depends on the countries spot mar-
ket  mechanism  preferences,  trading  intervals  to  submit  bids  in  spot
market  can  be  different.  For  instance,  in  NEM  of  Australia,  the  time
interval  for  electricity  trading  is  deﬁned  as  30  min  but  all  counter-
parts  can  give  their  bids  for  every  5  min.  In  Greece,  STA  has  single
and  separate  market  for  each  hour.  In  England  and  New  Zealand,
NETA  and  NZEM  have  48  half  hour  trading  periods  for  each  day.
In  IMO of Ontario bids and/or offers are submitted for every 5 min.
As  to  Elspot  in  Nordic  market,  market  participants  bid  for  purchase
and  sale  of  power  contracts  1-h  duration  for  all  24  h  of  the  next
day.  Turkish  electricity  market  has  been  operated  for  hourly  trading
interval,  too.
Three  types  of  pricing  mechanism  are  common  in  world’s  energy
markets:  Uniform  marginal  pricing,  zonal  pricing  and  locational
(or  nodal) pricing. In balance market, some other pricing system
which  is  called  as  pay-as-bid  or  discriminatory  pricing  system  can
also  be  seen  for  instance  Wales  and  England  market.  In  markets,
where  uniform  marginal  pricing  were  adopted,  only  one  energy
price  is  used  for  ex  post  settlement  for  each  trading  interval.
Generation  companies  can  make  certain  of  their  revenues  by  sign-
ing  bilateral  contracts  with  their  customers  at  ﬁxed  energy  prices.
In  zonal pricing systems, there is a geographical point of view to

market  structure  and  all  system  divided  sub  systems  with  respect
to  pre-deﬁned  geographical  areas,  called  zones.  When  there  is  no
congestion between zones, one uniform market clearing price is
used  throughout  the  system.  Under  congestion  conditions  all  zones
separated  each  other  and  produce  their  own  market  clearing  prices,
called  zonal  prices.  These  pricing  systems  have  congestion  risks  for
bilateral markets because of their uncertain and unpredictable pric-
ing mechanisms. Zonal pricing is still used in Nordic (11 zones) and
some  other  markets  [13].  Locational  marginal  pricing  is  the  deter-
mination of  prices  in  each  location  or  node  of  power  system.  When
there  is no congestion, one market clearing price is used in the sys-
tem  (ignoring  transmission  loses)  same  as  zonal  pricing.  In  zonal
and  locational  pricing  regimes,  except  contract  with  customers  at
the  same location or zone, all contracts are risky [1]. Theoretical
point  of  view,  methodology  for  each  pricing  system  is  the  same.
In Turkey, deregulation and reconstruction processes are pro-
ceeding.  Turkish  authorities  are  planning  to  reach  completely
deregulated  market  environment  before  2015.  With  respect  to
Turkey  Progress  Report  of  European  Union  2009,  the  thresh-
old  for  eligible  consumers  was  further  reduced  to  480,000  kWh,
equivalent  to  opening  50%  of  market  [14].  After  this  report  Turk-
ish  Energy Market Regulator Authority published new threshold
value  as  100,000  kWh  [15].  Turkey  is  adopting  European  Market
Model  to  itself,  in  that  respect  Nordic  Electricity  Market  struc-
ture  is  a  good  example  for  Turkey.  Turkish  electricity  market
consists  of  two  main  market  environments  now:  balanced  mar-
ket  for  balancing  load  imbalances  as  a  spot  market  and  bilateral
contract  application.  Day-ahead  planning  is  in  service  to  pre-
pare  market participants to day-ahead market. In near future (at
the  end  of  2011)  day-ahead  market  will  be  available  for  energy
traders.  In  Fig.  1  common  details  of  target  model  of  Turkey  can  be

 Portfolio  optimization  theory
3.1. Modern  portfolio  theory
In classical portfolio theory, it is thought that you can
avoid  your investment risk by constructing your portfolio from
different  industries’ shares, treasury bills with different maturities,
and  different  foreign  currencies,  in  other  words  via  diversiﬁcation.In
 modern portfolio theory, taking into consideration of relations
(correlations, co-movement)  of  portfolio  assets  with  each  other  is
very  important  and  diversiﬁcation  is  necessary  but  not  the  only
solution  of  portfolio  risk  management.  Taking  these  co-movements
of  securities  into  account  satisﬁes  an  ability  to  construct  a  port-
folio  that  has  the  same  expected  return  and  less  risky  portfolio
than  a  portfolio  constructed  by  ignoring  the  interactions  between
securities  [1].
It  is  impossible  for  investors  to  know  exactly  what  the  asset’s
return  and  risk  will  be  tomorrow,  so  they  are  using  some  forecast-
ing  tools to determine these values. The main problem by which
investors  must  be  faced  is  to  ﬁguring  out  weight  percentages  of
assets  being  in  the  portfolio.  This  problem  is  called  as  portfolio
selection  problem. To ﬁnd a solution to this problem, Harry M.
Markowitz  published  a  paper,  which  is  called  as  milestone  study
for portfolio theory and fundamentals of modern portfolio theory,
“Portfolio  Selection ”  in  1952  [3].  Markowitz,  in  his  famous  paper,
argued  that  a  process  of  portfolio  selection  can  be  divided  into  two
stages.  “The  ﬁrst  stage  starts  with  observation  and  experience  and  end
with  beliefs  about  the  future  performances  of  available  securities.  The
second  stage  starts  with  the  relevant  beliefs  about  future  performances
and  ends with the choice of portfolio.” His paper is concerned about
the  second  stage  [11].  His  body  of  work  on  portfolio  theory  resulted
in  him  being  awarded  Nobel  prize  in  economics  in  1990.  He  shared
this  prize  with  Merton  H.  Miller  and  William  F.  Sharpe  and  they
were  awarded  jointly  for  their  pioneering  work  in  the  theory  of
ﬁnancial  economics.  After  Markowitz’s  famous  paper,  theory  was
ampliﬁed  by  Sharpe  in  1964  and  by  Linther  in  1965  [16,17] .  The
addition  of a risk-free asset by Sharpe and Lintner in the mid 1960s
led  to  the  capital  market  line  and  the  CAPM  [18].
3.2.
 Portfolio  selection  and  determination  of  utility  function
Markowitz’s  portfolio  theory  is  based  on  a  mean-variance  opti-
mization process that searches for efﬁcient portfolios. An efﬁcient
portfolio  means  one  that  provides  minimum  risk  for  a  given  level  of
return or maximum return for a given level of risk [19]. It must be
done  another  basic  assumption  that  rational  risk-averse  investors
select  their portfolios using only mean-variance criteria. The main
assumptions  of the mean-variance analysis are based on the fol-
lowing  issues  [20]:360 F.  Gökgöz,  M.E.  Atmaca  /  Renewable  and  Sustainable  Energy  Reviews  16 (2012) 357–  368Expected Return (r)

•All
 investors  are  risk  averse  so  that  they  prefer  less  risk  to  more
for  the  same  level  of  expected  return.
•Investors  have  the  information  regarding  the  expected  returns,
variances  and  covariances  of  all  assets.
•Investors  need  only  to  know  the  expected  returns,  variances  and
the  covariances of returns to determine optimal portfolios.
•And  there  exist  no  transaction  costs  or  taxes  limitation.
The  required inputs necessary for mean-variance optimization
model are  the  expected  returns  for  each  asset,  the  variance  of  each
asset,  and  the  covariances  between  assets.  If  the  asset’s  returns  obey
a  normal  distribution,  then  the  entire  distribution  of  a  portfolio  can
be  described  by  the  mean  and  variance  only  [21].  Markowitz  mean-
variance  optimization  process  produces  an  efﬁcient  frontier  (Fig.  2)
which  consists  of  efﬁcient  portfolios  sets  on  it.
The  expected return for a particular portfolio, which includes
“N” assets, can be expressed as:
E(rp)  =N/summationdisplay
i=1Xiri (1)
while “N”  describes  number  of  assets  that  take  place  in  portfolio,
“Xi”  denotes  the  proportion  (weight  percentage)  of  ith  asset  in  port-
folio  and “ri”  denotes  expected  return  of  ith  asset.  The  variance  for
a  particular can be expressed as:
/ESC2
p=N/summationdisplay
i=1N/summationdisplay
j=1XiXj/ESCij (2)
“/ESCij”  is  the  covariance  between  the  returns  on  the  ith  asset  and  the
jth  asset. The covariance /ESCijmeasures  how  many  the  returns  on
two assets move together.
The  basic  mean-variance  optimization  model  includes  the  min-
imization of the portfolio’s variance under three fundamental
constraints.  These  constraints  are  expected  return  of  portfolio
must be equal to target return; the sum of the proportions of
ﬁnancial  assets  that  are  being  in  portfolio  must  be  equal  to  “1”
and  ﬁnally  non-negativity  condition  for  assets’  proportions.  Under
above  determined  conditions  it  can  be  set  the  basic  equation  as:
Min.

i=1Xi=  1  (5)Xi≥ 0, ∀Xi∈  [i  =  1,  2,  .  .  .  ,  N]
After  solution  of  this  problem  set  it  can  be  reached  the  efﬁcient
portfolios and efﬁcient frontier as shown in Fig. 2 for N risky assets
portfolio.
The main  issue  for  the  basic  mean-variance  optimization  model
is  the  determination  of  optimal  proportional  allocation  “Xi”  to  the
ith ﬁnancial asset. After determination of efﬁcient portfolios and
efﬁcient  frontier,  it  is  important  the  determination  of  investor’s
utility  functions  that  represent  investor’s  risk  aversion  level.  It  is
assumed  that  each  investor  can  assign  a  utility  score  to  compet-
ing investment portfolios based on expected return and risk of
those portfolios. Combining two, we can deﬁne the objective or
utility  function  for  an  investor  in  terms  of  expected  return  E(r)  and
variance  of  returns  /ESC2as  follows  [1,2,6,22,23] :
U =  E(r)  −1
2A/ESC2(6)
where U  is  the  utility  value  and  “A”  is  an  index  of  investor’s  risk
aversion. The factor of ½ is just a scaling convention. In ﬁnancial
approximations,  A  =  3  is  taken  for  representation  of  average  risk
aversion,  A  >  3  means  more  risk  aversion  and  A  <  3  means  less  risk
aversion.  In  the  light  of  above  information,  now  it  can  be  found
optimum portfolio for an investor that has level “A” risk aversion,
after the solution of below equations set:

4. Data  and  methodology
4.1.  Determination  of  risky  and  risk-free  assets
To apply  mean-variance  optimization  to  electricity  market,  ﬁrst
of  all it must be determined risky assets and to enlarge this appli-
cation also we need a risk-free asset. In Turkish electricity market,
we have system marginal prices and day-ahead market prices since
August  2006.  By  knowing  electricity  generation  costs  with  respect
to  their  types  (Hydraulic  Power  Plant,  Lignite  ﬁred  Thermal  Power
Plant,  Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant), we will use these
data  to represent risky assets. Bilateral contract prices with ﬁxed
values  (under  the  guarantee  of  clearing  authority)  will  be  used  to
represent  risk-free  asset.  Turkish  electricity  market’s  daily  average
spot  prices frequencies between August 2006 and April 2011 can be
seen  in  Fig.  3.  We  assumed  that  price  frequency  has  a  normal  dis-
tribution  around  mean.  In  calculations,  yearly  average  (US  Dollar
selling)  currency prices have been used [24].
Spot  market electricity prices and the amount of electricity
consumptions  (demand  for  electricity)  have  volatile  values  but
they  move together with high correlation. Both of these two
index can  importantly  change  with  respect  to  different  hours  ofF.  Gökgöz,  M.E.  Atmaca  /  Renewable  and  Sustainable  Energy  Reviews  16 (2012) 357–  368 361

day,  weekdays,  weekend,  months,  seasons,  years,  and  also  change
supply-demand  balance  and  system  congestions  but  each  of  them
follows  a  characteristic  way.  The  most  well-known  characteristic
is  hourly  demand  characteristics  of  consumers.  Starting  from  this
point  that consumers have similar consumption characteristics in
the  same  hours  of  a  day,  by  using  spot  prices  of  24  h  of  day,  24  risky
assets  have been determined. Above mentioned assumptions have
been taken to support this approach:
Daily  load  curves  that  have  chosen  randomly  for  different  years,
seasons,  months,  and  weekdays  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  4.  In  spite  of
the  all differences, consumers have similar consumption proﬁles for
ﬁve  different sample days. In such a way that load curves generally
decreases  after  10  p.m.  and  increases  after  7  a.m.  The  amount  of
electricity  consumption  is  low  for  the  ﬁrst  8  h  of  a  day.  In  all  curves
it  can be seen two or three head/shoulder formation shapes. Except
extreme  conditions  like  public  holidays,  religious  holidays,  very  hot
and  cold  days,  network  congestions  and  trip  of  generation  units  etc.
load  curves  proﬁle  does  not  change  so  much.  Statistical  point  of
view,  correlation constants for these ﬁve days are shown in Table 1:
As  can  be  seen  in  Table  1  that  load  curve  correlations  between
these  days  are  very  high  in  positive  direction  and  have  average  0.96
value.
The  same  characteristic  structure  of  load  curve  that  is  placed  in
Fig.  4  can  be  seen  in  hourly  spot  prices  as  well.  The  spot  prices  for
electricity  are  generally  low  for  the  ﬁrst  8  h  of  the  day.  There  are
dramatical  increase in prices after 7 a.m. while decrease in prices
after  10  p.m.  like  the  amount  of  electricity  consumed  by  customers
that  has  been  previously  shown  in  Fig.  4.
In  our  case,  because  of  above  mentioned  reasons,  instead  of
choosing  one  spot  price  to  represent  risky  asset  in  electricity  mar-
ket,  it  has  been  chosen  24  h  of  day’s  district  spot  prices  to  represent
24  risky  assets  in  electricity  spot  market.  For  analysis,  hourly

Price vectors  are  formed  as  seen  in  Eq.  (8).  Where/vectorfn[n  =  1,  2,  .  .  .,

day-ahead  prices.
In ﬁnancial  literature  rate  of  return  of  an  asset  can  be  determined
as  the  percentage  change  of  investor’s  wealth  from  the  beginning
to  the  end  of  a  term.  With  electricity  marketing  point  of  view  this
approach  is not true; we cannot economically store electricity or
hold like  other  securities  for  a  while  to  sell  later  and  this  product
must  be  generated  and  consumed  instantly.  So  it  must  be  taken
into  consideration  generation  cost  of  electricity.  So  Min  Liu  and
Felix  Wu had determined rate of return for electricity spot market
as;  “rate of return = (spot prices − generation  cost)/generation  cost”
[25].  Depends  on  your  assumptions  this  generation  cost  param-
eter  can  be  taken  as  dynamic  or  passive.  In  dynamic  approach

approach  like  in  this  study  it  can  be  taken  into  consideration  real
average  total electricity generation costs for a generation unit as a
constant  term. So that all price vectors in Eq. (8) are transferred to
the  rate  of  return  vectors  in  Eq.  (10)  by  applying  the  calculations  in
Eq.  (9).

4.2.1. Standard  mean-variance  optimization  model
In this  case  electricity  generators  have  only  opportunity  to
sell  their  generations  to  spot  electricity  markets.  That  means  it
is  constructed  and  used  optimization  model  with  24  risky  selling
alternatives.  It is called as standard mean-variance optimization
approach  and the mathematical programming formulations are
formed  as  follows:

day without  limitation.  Firstly  Eqs.  (15)–(17)  are  used  for  formation

To represent  average  risk-aversion  level,  “A”  is  taken  as  “3”
[2,25] .  Some researchers in ﬁnancial literature has been tried to
guess  the value of “A” for average risk aversion. In spite of there is
no  strict  value  determined  for  “A”  it  is  accepted  has  a  value  between
2  and  4  for  average  risk  aversion.  After  solution  of  above  determined

in  the  optimum  portfolio  for  an  electricity  generator  that  is  only
taking  into  consideration  of  24  risky  alternatives  in  spot  market  to
sell  electricity. To reach the minimum global variance portfolio it
is  necessary the solution of Eq. (21). After solutions of all equations

4.2.2.  Mean-variance  optimization  model  with  upper  investment
constraints
Unlike the standard Markowitz mean-variance approximation,
in  this  model,  electricity  generators  cannot  sell  all  energy  in  one  of
spot  market  hour  they  want.  Instead  of  this,  there  are  some  con-
straints  for  electricity  generators  for  selling  energy.  This  model
basically is  more  realistic  than  standard  model.  In  real  electric-
ity  market  environment  generators  (strategies  can  be  change  with
respect  to  type  of  generators;  hydraulic,  coal,  natural  gas,  nuclear,
etc.)  generally  prefer  less  risky  and  stable  conditions.  Selling  all
of  their  energy  to  spot  market  without  limitation  is  not  a  realistic
case.  So  that  it  is  constructed  and  used  optimization  model  with  24
risky  selling  alternatives  with  upper  constraints  for  selling  energy
to  each  hours  and  equation  sets  are  formed  as  follows:

0  ≤  Xn,  [n  =  1,  2,  .  .  .  ,  24]
In  above  equation  sets  it  is  used  same  standard  equations  with
standard model (Eqs. (15)–(17) ) we  talked  about  in  case  a  but  there
are  limitations  Xn≤  /DC2nfor  selling  electricity  in  spot  market  hours  in
this  model.  These  limitations  can  be  gotten  different  values  also  but
in  our  model  all  of  them  are  taken  same  and  equal  to  /DC2n.  After  the
solution  of  Eqs.  (22)–(25)  efﬁcient  portfolios  and  efﬁcient  frontier
are  obtained  like  in  previous  case.  Second  step  is  here  ﬁnding  opti-
mal  portfolio with in efﬁcient portfolios alternatives with respect
to  electricity generators’ risk aversion characteristic. To ﬁnd the
optimal  portfolio,  utility  function  as  mentioned  before  in  Eq.  (7)  is
used  and  optimization  equation  set  is  given  by  as  follows:

To represent  average  risk-aversion  level  “A”  is  taken  as  “3”.  After
solution  of  above  determined  equation  sets  it  is  reached  optimal
weight percentages of risky assets in the optimum portfolio for an
electricity generator that is taking into consideration of 24 riskyalternatives
 in  spot  market  to  sell  electricity  with  /DC2nlimitation
for  each  hour.  Reaching  to  minimum  global  variance  portfolio  it
is  also  necessary  solution  of  Eq.  (21).  After  solutions  of  all  equa-
tions  placed  above  it  is  reached  results  graphic  as  shown  in  Fig.  5
same  as  previous  case.
4.2.3.  Mean-variance  optimization  with  one  risk-free  asset
This case  includes  24  risky  assets  and  additional  one  risk-free
asset  for  electricity  generators.  Bilateral  contracts  under  guarantee
of clearing  authorities  assumed  as  risk-free  assets  with  their  ﬁxed
prices  for  a  ﬁxed  period  of  time.  There  are  no  limitations  for  elec-
tricity  generators  to  sell  their  electricity  in  risky  spot  market  hours
or  via  bilateral  contracts.  That  means  it  is  constructed  and  used
optimization  model  with  one  risk-free  and  24  risky  selling  alterna-
tive.  It  is  called  as  mean-variance  optimization  with  one  risk-free
asset  approach  and  related  equation  sets  are  formed  as  follows:

0 ≤  Xrf≤  1
0 ≤  Xn≤  1,  ∀Xn∈  [n  =  1,  2,  .  .  .  ,  24]
By
 solution of these equation sets for every expected rate of
return  it  is  obtained  efﬁcient  portfolios  and  efﬁcient  frontier.  Eq.
(31)  shows  total  weight  percentage  of  portfolio  assets  including
risk-free  asset  and  this  value  cannot  exceed  1.  There  are  no  limita-
tions for electricity generators like in case a but in this case extra
one  risk  free  asset  (bilateral  contract  option)  for  electricity  gener-
ators.  To  prevent  from  risk,  more  risk  averse  generators  can  prefer
selling  their  generations  into  bilateral  market  instead  of  spot  mar-
ket. To ﬁnd the optimal selling portfolio for electricity generators
with  average  risk-aversion,  value  of  “A”  is  taken  3  again  and  Eq.  (7)
is  used  for  utility  function  (U)  and  the  optimization  constraints  as
follows:

tract),  E(rc)  is  the  expected  rate  of  return  for  mixed  portfolio  which
constitutes  of  risky  and  risk-free  assets,  and  /ESC2

By  solution  of  above  equation  sets  it  can  be  obtained  weight
percentages  of  optimal  portfolio  in  a  risky  and  risk-free  market
environment.  To represent average risk-aversion level, “A” is taken
as  3  again.  Reaching  to  minimum  global  variance  portfolio  it  is  also
necessary  solution  of  Eq.  (21).  After  solutions  of  all  Eqs.  (29)–(36)  it
is  reached  results  graphic  as  shown  in  Fig.  5  same  as  previous  cases.
5. Results
All  cases  which  have  been  determined  in  previous  sections
are  applied  to  three  speciﬁc  examples;  Hydraulic  Power  Plants
with  CH=  0.99  cent/kWh,  Lignite  Fired  Thermal  Power  Plants  with
CT=  8.50  cent/kWh,  and  Natural  Gas  Combined  Cycle  Power  Plantswith CN=  10.31  cent/kWh.  They  have  been  calculated  means  and
variances  of each hour for three special cases and shown in the
following tables (Tables 3–5).
In all cases while ﬁnding optimum portfolios, “A” is taken 3 for
average risk aversion and 1000 for global minimum variance port-
folios.  Actually  with  respect  to  Eq.  (16)  “A”  must  be  taken  inﬁnity
to  ﬁnd  global  variance  portfolios  but  in  practice  this  is  not  appli-
cable  situation  and  it  has  been  seen  some  error  propagations  had
occurred  when  taken  “A”  with  high  values.  So  “A”  has  been  taken
1000  to  ﬁnd  global  variance  portfolios.
5.1. Efﬁcient frontier and optimum portfolio for hydraulic power
plants
Case a.  Standard  mean-variance  optimization:  there  are  24  risky
assets  for  electricity  generators  and  no  limitation  for  selling  of  elec-
tricity  in  spot  market’s  hours.  “OP”  represents  optimum  portfolio
and “GMVP” represents global minimum variance portfolio in Fig. 6
and  next  graphics.

ment  constraints:  there  are  24  risky  assets  for  electricity  generatorsF.  Gökgöz,  M.E.  Atmaca  /  Renewable  and  Sustainable  Energy  Reviews  16 (2012) 357–  368 365

but  there  are  also  upper  limit  determined  for  electricity  trading  for
each  hour.  When  this  limit  is  taken  as  12.63%  for  each  hour  it  has
been  reached  results  in  Fig.  7.
Case  c.  Mean-variance  optimization  model  with  one  risk-free
asset:  in  this  case  beside  the  24  risky  assets  there  is  also  one  risk-
free  asset  (bilateral  contract).  Rate  of  return  for  bilateral  contract  is
assumed  as  750%  (8.415  cent/kWh ,  this  is  because  of  low  generation
costs  of  hydraulic  power  plants )  (Fig.  8).
